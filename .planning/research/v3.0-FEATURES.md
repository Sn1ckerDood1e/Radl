# Feature Landscape: Production UX Polish

**Domain:** SaaS production polish for rowing team management (Radl)
**Researched:** 2026-01-29
**Confidence:** HIGH (patterns well-established, verified with multiple sources)

## Executive Summary

Production-ready SaaS polish focuses on six key areas: loading states, error handling, empty states, calendar UX, drag-drop UX, and legal pages. Based on analysis of the existing Radl codebase (136k LOC, shadcn/ui + Tailwind v4), the app already has foundational components (`Skeleton`, `EmptyState`, `Drawer`) but needs systematic application of polish patterns across all views.

**Current State Assessment:**
- Loading: Has `loading.tsx` files with skeletons for some routes, but inconsistent
- Empty States: Has `EmptyState` component but basic (text-only, no illustrations)
- Calendar: Uses react-day-picker with custom styling, mobile issues noted
- Drag-Drop: Uses dnd-kit with PointerSensor, touch support needs optimization
- Legal: No legal pages exist currently

## Table Stakes

Features users expect from a production SaaS. Missing these = product feels unfinished.

### 1. Consistent Loading State Patterns

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Dependencies |
|---------|--------------|------------|--------------|
| Skeleton screens for all list views | Users expect visual feedback during load; prevents layout shift | Low | Existing `Skeleton` component |
| Page-level loading states (via loading.tsx) | Next.js convention, instant visual feedback | Low | Existing pattern in some routes |
| Inline loading for form submissions | Users need feedback that action is processing | Low | Button component `isLoading` prop |
| Delayed spinner threshold (300ms) | Prevents spinner flash for fast operations | Medium | Custom `DelayedSpinner` component |
| Progress indicators for long operations | Operations >10s need explicit duration feedback | Medium | New `ProgressBar` component |

**Implementation Notes:**
- Skeletons should mirror actual content layout exactly to prevent layout shift
- Use `animate-pulse` (already in Skeleton component) for shimmer effect
- Smaller components (buttons, form fields) should NOT use skeletons; use disabled state or spinner

### 2. User-Friendly Error Messages

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Dependencies |
|---------|--------------|------------|--------------|
| Inline field validation with clear messages | Users need to know what went wrong and how to fix it | Low | Existing form validation |
| Error state styling (red border + icon) | Visual differentiation from normal state | Low | Tailwind classes |
| Error summary for form submission failures | Screen readers and users need overview | Medium | Form component enhancement |
| Retry mechanisms for network errors | Users shouldn't have to manually refresh | Medium | Error boundary + retry logic |
| Graceful degradation messages | Offline/error states should guide, not abandon | Medium | Existing offline indicator |

**Implementation Notes:**
- Validate on blur for most fields; required fields only on submit
- Keep submit button enabled (don't disable preemptively)
- Error messages should be: explicit, human-readable, polite, precise, constructive
- Use icons alongside color for accessibility (colorblind users)

**Best Practices:**
1. Message placement: inline with field, not in separate location
2. Style: red border + red text + error icon (left of message)
3. Content: "Password must be at least 8 characters" not "Invalid password"
4. Keep main action button enabled; show errors after attempted submission

### 3. Strategic Empty State Design

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Dependencies |
|---------|--------------|------------|--------------|
| Informational empty states | Explain what belongs here, reduce confusion | Low | Existing `EmptyState` component |
| Action-oriented empty states | Guide users to populate content | Low | Existing `EmptyState` with action prop |
| First-run experience with starter guidance | New users need direction | Medium | Progressive disclosure pattern |
| Zero-result search states | Differentiate "nothing here" from "nothing found" | Low | Search component enhancement |
| Celebratory empty states (inbox zero) | Acknowledge completion, positive reinforcement | Low | New variant for `EmptyState` |

**Implementation Notes:**
- Structure: Headline first, then explanation, then CTA
- Illustrations: Optional, keep monochrome to blend with interface
- Include empty states in design system (not ad-hoc per page)
- Starter content option: provide sample data for new users to explore

**Current State:** `EmptyState` component exists with icon, title, description, action. Enhancement needed for:
- Illustration support (optional)
- Multiple variants (informational, action, celebration, error)
- Consistent application across all list views

### 4. Mobile-Friendly Calendar UX

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Dependencies |
|---------|--------------|------------|--------------|
| Touch-friendly day cells (min 44px) | Apple/Google guidelines for touch targets | Low | CSS adjustment |
| Swipe gestures for month navigation | Natural mobile interaction pattern | Medium | Existing `use-swipe-gesture` hook |
| Bottom sheet date picker on mobile | Standard mobile pattern, easier thumb reach | Medium | Existing `Drawer` component |
| Responsive month view (single column on small screens) | Calendar grid too dense on phones | Medium | CSS media queries |
| Quick date selection presets | "Today", "Tomorrow", "Next Week" | Low | Date picker enhancement |

**Current State:** Uses react-day-picker with custom CSS. Day cells are 44px (good). Issues:
- Month navigation via small arrows (hard to tap)
- Calendar popover on mobile (should be bottom sheet)
- No swipe navigation between months

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Use `Drawer` (already exists, uses vaul) for mobile date picker
2. Add swipe gesture support using existing `use-swipe-gesture` hook
3. Add quick presets for common date selections
4. Consider year navigation dropdown (especially for birthdates)

### 5. Touch-Optimized Drag-Drop

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Dependencies |
|---------|--------------|------------|--------------|
| Touch sensor with activation delay | Differentiate tap from drag intent | Low | dnd-kit TouchSensor config |
| Drag handle indicators | Show users where to grab on touch | Low | Icon addition to draggable items |
| Visual feedback during drag (elevation, shadow) | User knows drag is active | Low | Existing overlay styling |
| Drop zone highlighting | Clear target indication | Low | dnd-kit droppable styling |
| Keyboard alternatives for accessibility | Arrow keys, Space to pick up/drop | Medium | dnd-kit keyboard sensor |

**Current State:** Multi-boat lineup builder uses dnd-kit with PointerSensor (8px activation constraint). Has:
- `DragOverlay` for visual feedback
- `closestCenter` collision detection
- Keyboard sensor with sortable coordinates

**Mobile Issues Identified:**
- PointerSensor may conflict with scroll on touch devices
- No explicit drag handles (entire card is draggable)
- May need `touch-action: none` on drag handles

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Add TouchSensor with delay activation (250ms hold)
2. Add explicit drag handle icon to draggable cards
3. Set `touch-action: none` only on drag handles (preserves scroll)
4. Add "magnetic" snap animation when dropping (100ms ease-out)

### 6. Legal Pages (Terms of Service, Privacy Policy)

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Dependencies |
|---------|--------------|------------|--------------|
| Terms of Service page | Legal requirement for SaaS operation | Low | Static page, legal content |
| Privacy Policy page | Legal requirement (GDPR, CCPA compliance) | Low | Static page, legal content |
| Cookie consent banner | GDPR requirement for EU users | Medium | Cookie management library |
| Acceptance tracking | Record when users agreed to terms | Medium | Database + auth integration |
| Version history | Track policy changes over time | Low | Git + last-modified date |

**Content Requirements for Privacy Policy:**
1. What data is collected (user-provided, automatic, third-party)
2. Purpose of data collection
3. Data sharing practices
4. User rights (access, deletion, portability)
5. Security measures
6. Contact information
7. Update notification process

**Content Requirements for Terms of Service:**
1. Service description and acceptable use
2. User responsibilities
3. Payment terms (if applicable)
4. Intellectual property rights
5. Limitation of liability
6. Termination conditions
7. Dispute resolution
8. Governing law

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use MDX or static content (not CMS for legal pages)
- Include "Last updated" date prominently
- Link from footer on all pages
- Consider checkbox acceptance during signup
- GDPR: Explicit consent, not pre-checked boxes

## Differentiators

Features that set product apart. Not expected, but valued when present.

### 1. Progressive Loading with Content Priority

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Dependencies |
|---------|-------------------|------------|--------------|
| Primary content loads first | Reduces perceived wait time | Medium | Code splitting, suspense boundaries |
| Background data prefetching | Instant navigation to likely next screens | High | React Query/SWR prefetch |
| Optimistic UI updates | Actions feel instant | Medium | Mutation hooks with rollback |

**Why Differentiating:** Most SaaS apps show all-or-nothing loading. Progressive loading with prioritized content (structure first, then data, then images) feels premium.

---

### 2. Smart Empty States with Onboarding

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Dependencies |
|---------|-------------------|------------|--------------|
| Contextual onboarding tips | Guide new users without separate onboarding flow | Medium | Feature flag for first-time users |
| Starter templates | Pre-built practice plans, lineup templates | Low | Seed data system |
| Progress checklist | Show setup completion status | Medium | User metadata tracking |

**Why Differentiating:** Reduces time-to-value. Users can start using the app immediately rather than facing blank screens.

---

### 3. Gesture-Based Navigation

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Dependencies |
|---------|-------------------|------------|--------------|
| Swipe between pages | Natural mobile navigation | Medium | Page transition system |
| Pull-to-refresh | Standard mobile pattern | Low | Native or library support |
| Swipe to reveal actions | Quick actions without navigation | Medium | Existing `use-swipe-gesture` hook |

**Current State:** Has `use-swipe-gesture` hook for list items. Could extend to page-level navigation.

---

### 4. Micro-interactions and Polish

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Dependencies |
|---------|-------------------|------------|--------------|
| Success animations | Positive feedback for completed actions | Low | CSS animations or Lottie |
| Button press feedback | Tactile feel on mobile | Low | CSS `:active` states |
| Smooth page transitions | Professional feel | Medium | Framer Motion or CSS |

---

## Anti-Features

Features to explicitly NOT build. Common mistakes in this domain.

### 1. Loading Spinners for Everything

**Why Avoid:** Spinners provide no context about what's loading or how long. They communicate "wait" without progress.

**What to Do Instead:**
- Skeleton screens for content
- Progress bars for operations >10s
- Inline indicators for form submissions
- No indicator at all for operations <300ms

---

### 2. Toast Overload

**Why Avoid:** Every action showing a toast is noisy and trains users to ignore notifications.

**What to Do Instead:**
- Toast for async operations that complete in background
- Toast for errors that need acknowledgment
- Inline success for form submissions (already have `inline-success` component)
- No toast for obvious, immediate results

---

### 3. Modal Dialogs for Everything

**Why Avoid:** Modals interrupt flow, require extra clicks to dismiss, and are frustrating on mobile.

**What to Do Instead:**
- Inline editing where possible
- Bottom sheets on mobile (already using Drawer/vaul)
- Pages for complex flows
- Modals only for confirmations and critical decisions

---

### 4. Disabled Submit Buttons Until Form Valid

**Why Avoid:** Users don't know why button is disabled. Creates confusion and frustration.

**What to Do Instead:**
- Keep button enabled
- Show validation errors on submit
- Inline validation on blur for complex fields
- Clear error messaging explaining what's wrong

---

### 5. Custom Calendar/Date Picker from Scratch

**Why Avoid:** Date handling is complex (timezones, locales, accessibility). Custom implementations usually have bugs.

**What to Do Instead:**
- Use established libraries (react-day-picker, already in use)
- Enhance with responsive wrappers (Drawer on mobile)
- Style to match design system, but keep core logic

---

### 6. Aggressive Feature Gating

**Why Avoid:** Too many "upgrade to access" prompts feels hostile, especially during trial.

**What to Do Instead:**
- Let users explore features with sample/demo data
- Soft limits with warnings before hard blocks
- Upsell at natural moments (not interrupting flow)

## MVP Recommendation

For production launch, prioritize:

### Must Have (Table Stakes)
1. **Consistent loading skeletons** - All list views need loading.tsx files with skeletons matching content structure
2. **Error message polish** - Inline validation, clear messages, enabled submit buttons
3. **Empty state coverage** - EmptyState component applied to all list views
4. **Calendar mobile fix** - Bottom sheet picker on mobile via Drawer
5. **Drag-drop touch optimization** - TouchSensor with delay, drag handles
6. **Legal pages** - Terms of Service and Privacy Policy (content can be basic)

### Defer to Post-Launch
- Progressive loading with prefetching (complexity)
- Onboarding checklists (need usage data first)
- Micro-interactions and animations (polish, not blocking)
- Cookie consent banner (if not serving EU users initially)
- Acceptance tracking with versioning

### Complexity Estimates

| Feature Area | Low Complexity | Medium Complexity | High Complexity |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Loading States | Skeletons, inline loading | Delayed spinner, progress bar | Prefetching |
| Error Handling | Inline validation, styling | Error summaries, retry logic | - |
| Empty States | Apply existing component | New variants | Starter content |
| Calendar | CSS touch sizes | Bottom sheet wrapper | - |
| Drag-Drop | Drag handles, CSS | TouchSensor config | - |
| Legal | Static pages | Acceptance tracking | GDPR compliance |

---

## Confidence Assessment

| Area | Confidence | Reason |
|------|------------|--------|
| Loading Patterns | HIGH | Well-documented patterns, existing component |
| Error UX | HIGH | Established best practices, existing validation |
| Empty States | HIGH | Simple enhancement of existing component |
| Calendar Mobile | MEDIUM | react-day-picker mobile support is limited; may need custom wrapper |
| Drag-Drop Touch | MEDIUM | dnd-kit supports touch, but needs testing on actual devices |
| Legal Pages | HIGH | Standard templates available, content is straightforward |
