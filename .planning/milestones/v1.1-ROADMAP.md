# Milestone v1.1: Polish

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-22
**Phases:** 6-9
**Total Plans:** 2 formal + 2 direct implementations

## Overview

v1.1 is a polish release that fills UI gaps left in v1.0's rapid development. Four focused phases deliver: RC connection management UI, equipment usage visibility, expanded notifications (deferred), and data export capabilities.

## Phases

### Phase 6: RC Settings UI

**Goal:** Coaches can manage their Regatta Central integration from within the app.
**Depends on:** Phase 5 (Regatta Mode)
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01: Foundation — Sonner toasts, schema update, auto-sync API
- [x] 06-02: RC settings components and settings page integration

**Details:**
- Coach can view RC connection status in settings
- Coach can connect/disconnect RC account via OAuth (UI built, needs credentials)
- Coach can trigger manual regatta import (UI built, needs credentials)
- Coach can toggle auto-sync on/off

### Phase 7: Equipment Usage Display

**Goal:** Coaches can see how equipment is being used (usage collected in v1.0 now surfaced).
**Depends on:** Phase 3 (Lineup Management)
**Plans:** Implemented directly

**Details:**
- Equipment detail page shows chronological usage log
- Equipment list page shows usage summary (most used, recent activity)
- Usage data links back to practices

### Phase 8: Notifications (DEFERRED)

**Goal:** Stakeholders receive timely alerts for equipment issues and lineup availability.
**Depends on:** Phase 4 (PWA Infrastructure)
**Plans:** Deferred to future milestone

**Details:**
- NOTIF-01: Coach receives notification when equipment is marked damaged — DEFERRED
- NOTIF-02: Athletes receive notification when lineup is published — DEFERRED

### Phase 9: Data Export

**Goal:** Coaches can export operational data for external use (reporting, backup, sharing).
**Depends on:** None
**Plans:** Implemented directly

**Details:**
- Equipment export to CSV (all fields)
- Roster export to CSV (member info)
- Schedule export to CSV (current month events)
- All exports trigger immediate download

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:** None

**Key Decisions:**
- Phase 8 (Notifications) explicitly deferred to future milestone
- Phases 7 and 9 implemented directly during user testing without formal GSD plans
- RC connection testing deferred until API credentials obtained
- QR code external scanning deferred until production deployment

**Issues Resolved:**
- QR code URL generation fixed (window.location.origin fallback)
- RC Organization ID label clarified (not USRowing ID)

**Issues Deferred:**
- RC API credentials needed for connection testing
- Push notifications (Phase 8) moved to future milestone
- QR scanning from external devices requires production deployment

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Phase 8 requirements (NOTIF-01, NOTIF-02) unfulfilled
