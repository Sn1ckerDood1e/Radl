## v1 Requirements

### Security & Foundation
- [x] **SEC-01**: Fix JWT claims verification gaps — ensure tokens are validated before trusting claims
- [x] **SEC-02**: Add rate limiting to sensitive endpoints — protect auth, invitations, damage reports
- [x] **SEC-03**: Audit and verify multi-tenant data isolation — confirm RLS policies, add missing filters

### Seasons
- [x] **SEASON-01**: Create season container model — group practices and regattas by season
- [x] **SEASON-02**: Implement season-scoped eligibility — athletes can be active/inactive per season

### Practice Scheduling
- [x] **PRAC-01**: Create practices with time blocks — date, start/end, typed blocks (water/land/erg)
- [x] **PRAC-02**: Add block metadata — single/interval, time/distance values, category tags
- [x] **PRAC-03**: Create reusable practice templates — save and apply practice structures
- [x] **PRAC-04**: Build unified calendar view — display practices and regattas together

### Lineups
- [x] **LINE-01**: Build lineup editor — define athletes with seat positions
- [x] **LINE-02**: Implement boat assignment — assign compatible available boat to lineup
- [x] **LINE-03**: Create reusable lineup templates — save and apply lineup configurations
- [x] **LINE-04**: Implement group-based assignment — land/erg blocks use groups not individual seats

### Equipment Operational
- [x] **EQUIP-01**: Auto-generate usage logs — record equipment use from practice assignments
- [x] **EQUIP-02**: Implement readiness state — derive from damage reports + maintenance flags + overrides
- [x] **EQUIP-03**: Enforce availability at assignment — block assignment of unavailable equipment

### Regatta Mode
- [x] **REG-01**: Integrate Regatta Central API — OAuth2 auth, per-team keys, fetch race schedules
- [x] **REG-02**: Support manual regatta/race entry — for regattas not on RC or offline creation
- [x] **REG-03**: Build timeline view — chronological display of team's races at regatta
- [x] **REG-04**: Enable lineup assignment per entry — assign athletes to each race (fresh or template)
- [x] **REG-05**: Implement race notifications — push alerts with configurable timing before races
- [x] **REG-06**: Add meeting location field — specify where to rig/launch for each race
- [x] **REG-07**: Add notes field — helper athletes, special instructions per race
- [x] **REG-08**: Build offline capability — cache schedules/lineups, queue actions, sync when online

### PWA Infrastructure
- [x] **PWA-01**: Set up service worker with caching — basic PWA shell, manifest, offline fallback
- [x] **PWA-02**: Implement push notifications — VAPID keys, subscription management, delivery
- [x] **PWA-03**: Add IndexedDB offline storage — local storage for schedules, lineups, regatta data
- [x] **PWA-04**: Implement background sync — queue offline actions, sync on reconnect (with fallback)

### Tech Debt
- [x] **DEBT-01**: Extract claims helper utility — DRY up duplicated JWT decode + fallback pattern
- [x] **DEBT-02**: Refactor oversized form components — split equipment, damage report, CSV import forms
- [x] **DEBT-03**: Add query caching — cache stable data (equipment lists, roster, team settings)

- [ ] Season templates — copy settings between seasons
- [ ] Email notifications — email fallback for push notifications
- [ ] Erg results tracking — store and display erg test scores
- [ ] Attendance analytics — reporting on practice attendance patterns
- [ ] Equipment lifecycle tracking — maintenance schedules, age-based alerts
- [ ] Parent portal — dedicated parent view with child's schedule/races
- [ ] Native mobile apps — iOS/Android apps if PWA insufficient
- [ ] RC import UI — add settings/regattas page for Regatta Central connection
- [ ] Equipment usage display — show usage history on equipment detail page

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Financial tracking / payroll | Not team operations focus |
| Inventory accounting | Equipment is operational, not financial |
| Checkout systems unrelated to practices | Equipment tied to practices only |
| Results database | Regatta Central handles official results |
| Registration/payment | Out of scope for internal execution tool |
| Public scoring | Not a spectator-facing app |
| Messaging platform | Not a communication-first tool |
| Social features | Not a social network |
| Video analysis | Specialized tools exist |
| Erg training platform | ErgData, Concept2 logbook exist |
