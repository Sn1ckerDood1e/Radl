## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Location field workaround: Use notes field for practice location (acceptable for MVP)
- Meeting blocks minimal content: Notes-only sufficient for meeting blocks (by design)
- Form validation: Standardized on onTouched mode for immediate feedback

**Issues Resolved:**
- Signup redirect parameter not preserved through OAuth flow
- Team creation not creating ClubMembership record
- Invitation toast text misleading ("sent" vs "created")
- Equipment page missing empty state for new teams

**Issues Deferred:**
- Email sending for invitations (coaches share links manually)
- Push notifications (v3.0)
- Dynamic team colors (settings section removed)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None - this was a testing/verification milestone
