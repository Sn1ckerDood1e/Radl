|------|-----|--------|
| Phase 6 (RC Settings) | Phase 5 (RC Connection) | ✓ Wired |
| Phase 7 (Usage Display) | Phase 3 (Lineups) | ✓ Wired |
| Phase 9 (Export) | All data models | ✓ Wired |

### E2E Flows

| Flow | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Coach views equipment usage | ✓ Pass | Detail page + list summary |
| Coach exports equipment CSV | ✓ Pass | Downloads immediately |
| Coach exports roster CSV | ✓ Pass | Downloads immediately |
| Coach exports schedule CSV | ✓ Pass | Downloads immediately |
| Coach views RC status | ✓ Pass | Settings page shows status |
| Coach toggles auto-sync | ✓ Pass | Toggle works with toast feedback |
| Coach connects RC | ⚠ Untested | Needs API credentials |

## Tech Debt

### Phase 6: RC Settings UI

1. **RC connection flow untested** - UI is complete but requires `RC_CLIENT_ID` and `RC_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables to test actual connection
2. **QR code external scanning** - QR codes generate correctly but cannot be scanned from mobile devices while running on localhost

### Phase 8: Notifications (Deferred)

1. **NOTIF-01: Equipment damage notification** - Deferred to future milestone
2. **NOTIF-02: Lineup published notification** - Deferred to future milestone

## Recommendation

**Status: tech_debt** - No critical blockers. 2 notification requirements explicitly deferred. Milestone can be completed with deferred items tracked.

**Action:** Proceed with `/gsd:complete-milestone 1.1` accepting:
- Phase 8 deferred to future milestone
- RC testing deferred until credentials obtained
- QR external scanning deferred until production deployment
