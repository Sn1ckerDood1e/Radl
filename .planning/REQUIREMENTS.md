## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Financial tracking / payroll | Not a team management focus |
| Inventory accounting | Equipment is operational, not financial |
| Checkout systems unrelated to practices | Equipment tied to practices only |
| Results database | Regatta Central handles official results |
| Registration/payment | Out of scope for internal execution tool |
| Public scoring | Not a spectator-facing app |
| Messaging-first workflows | Not a communication platform |
| Social features | Not a social network |
| Native mobile apps | PWA sufficient for v1 |
