## The Honey Badger

### Why the Honey Badger

The honey badger (*Mellivora capensis*, also called *ratel*) is the most tenacious animal on earth. It's not the biggest or flashiest — but it never, ever quits.

| Trait | Connection to Radl |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Fearless** | Takes on challenges regardless of size |
| **Tenacious** | Never quits until the job is done |
| **Relentless** | Persistent effort wins over raw power |
| **Thick-skinned** | Handles setbacks, keeps moving |
| **Underestimated** | Small but mighty |
| **Distinctive** | No other rowing program has this symbol |

### The Story

> "The honey badger doesn't care how big the challenge is. It doesn't care what's in the way. It just keeps working until it wins. That's what diligence looks like. That's Radl."

## Motto

### Diligentia Vincit

**Translation**: "Diligence conquers"

The Latin motto captures what the honey badger represents — victory through persistent, careful, relentless effort.

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Diligentia** | Diligence, carefulness, persistence |
| **Vincit** | Conquers, wins, prevails |

**Pronunciation**: dih-lih-GEN-tee-ah WIN-kit

---

## Tagline Options

| Tagline | Tone |
|---------|------|
| **Diligence wins.** | Direct translation of motto, confident |
| **Relentless by design.** | Speaks to the honey badger and the software |
| **Never quit. Win.** | Ultra short, punchy, honey badger energy |
| **Built for crews who don't quit.** | Speaks to the audience |

**Recommended**: "Diligence wins." — Simple, confident, ties directly to the motto.

## The Crest

### Design Philosophy

The Radl crest follows the tradition of established rowing clubs — Penn AC, Thames Rowing Club, Cambridge Boat Club, Kent School. It should feel like it belongs in that company, but with the distinctive honey badger as its centerpiece.

**Style**: Collegiate athletic — bold, structured, works on uniforms and merchandise.

### Reference Programs

| Organization | What to Learn |
|--------------|---------------|
| **Penn AC** | Classic shield, ribbon banner, balanced composition |
| **Thames Rowing Club** | Traditional British quality, crossed oars |
| **Kent School** | Collegiate athletic boldness, works at all sizes |
| **Cambridge Boat Club** | Clean traditional, dignified presence |

### Crest Components

1. **Shield** — Traditional heraldic shape, teal field
2. **Honey Badger** — Central charge, in profile facing left, white/silver on teal
3. **Crossed Oars** — Behind the shield, white/silver (optional)
4. **Motto Banner** — Curved ribbon below, "DILIGENTIA VINCIT"
5. **Border** — Clean edge on shield (optional)

### Honey Badger Rendering

**Pose**: Profile view, facing left (heraldic dexter). Standing or walking. Head slightly raised, alert and confident.

**Style**:
- Naturalistic anatomy, stylized for heraldic use
- Dignified, not cute, not cartoonish
- Clean lines for embroidery and small reproduction
- Clear silhouette at small sizes

**Do NOT**:
- Make it cute or friendly
- Use cartoon style
- Make it aggressive/snarling
- Use front-facing view
