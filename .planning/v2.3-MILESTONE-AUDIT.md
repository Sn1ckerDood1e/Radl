## Bug Fixes Delivered

Phase 28 included bug fixes discovered during testing:

Phase 31 delivered:

## Known Limitations (Acceptable)

| Item | Phase | Reason |
|------|-------|--------|
| Email verification requires real email | 28 | Supabase handles, cannot mock |
| Invitation email not sent | 28 | By design - coaches share links manually |
| Facility-owned equipment (teamId=null) cannot receive reports | 30 | Edge case, acceptable for MVP |
| Usage logs persist if lineup deleted | 30 | Historical data preservation |
| QR URL requires NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL | 30 | Production config, not code issue |

## Tech Debt

**None identified during this milestone.**

Previous tech debt items remain in backlog (from v2.2):
- RC connection testing (needs credentials)
- Push notifications (v3.0)
- Dynamic team colors (deferred, UI placeholder removed in Phase 31)

## Audit Result

**PASSED**

All requirements met. All flows complete. Integration verified. Ready for beta release.
