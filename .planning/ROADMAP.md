### ✅ v2.2 Security Audit — COMPLETE

**Milestone Goal:** Validate security architecture before beta testing through comprehensive audit of authentication, authorization, tenant isolation, secrets management, logging, and rate limiting.

**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED COMPLETE (2026-01-29)

**Results:** 31 PASS, 2 CONDITIONAL PASS, 2 DEFERRED, 0 FAIL

---

#### ✅ Phase 25: API Authentication & JWT Security — COMPLETE

**Goal:** All API routes are secured with verified JWT authentication and proper session management

**Depends on:** Phase 24 (Practice Flow Redesign - completed)

**Requirements:** AUTH-01, AUTH-02, AUTH-03, AUTH-04, AUTH-05, AUTH-06, AUTH-07

**Delivered:**
- 88 API routes audited (all protected or justified public)
- JWT signature verification via getUser() on every request
- Expired/tampered tokens rejected server-side
- Session persistence via httpOnly cookies + middleware refresh
- Logout functionality with cookie cleanup

**Plans:** 4 plans (3 audit + 1 gap closure)

Plans:
- [x] 25-01-PLAN.md — API route authentication audit (AUTH-01)
- [x] 25-02-PLAN.md — JWT security testing (AUTH-02, AUTH-03, AUTH-04)
- [x] 25-03-PLAN.md — Session management testing (AUTH-05, AUTH-06, AUTH-07)
- [x] 25-04-PLAN.md — Logout implementation (AUTH-06 gap closure)

---

#### ✅ Phase 26: RBAC & Tenant Isolation — COMPLETE

**Goal:** Role boundaries are enforced and tenant data is isolated at both database and application layers

**Depends on:** Phase 25

**Requirements:** RBAC-01, RBAC-02, RBAC-03, RBAC-04, RBAC-05, RBAC-06, RBAC-07, ISOL-01, ISOL-02, ISOL-03, ISOL-04, ISOL-05, ISOL-06

**Delivered:**
- 163 new tests (109 CASL unit tests, 17 API integration tests, 17 role propagation tests, 20 pgTAP RLS tests)
- RLS audit: 5/43 tables have RLS (core tenant tables), application layer protects rest
- CASL enforcement audit: 88 API routes verified, all secure
- JWT claims traced from custom_access_token_hook through RLS helper functions to policies
- Role propagation verified: database lookup per request, not JWT-only
- API response audit: 404 pattern prevents resource enumeration

**Status:** 9 PASS, 2 CONDITIONAL PASS, 2 DEFERRED, 0 FAIL

**Plans:** 9 plans in 4 waves

Plans:
- [x] 26-01-PLAN.md — RLS audit: document all tables, policies, and gaps (ISOL-01, ISOL-02)
- [x] 26-02-PLAN.md — CASL ability unit tests for all 5 roles (RBAC-01, RBAC-02, RBAC-03, RBAC-04)
- [x] 26-03-PLAN.md — CASL server-side enforcement audit (RBAC-06)
- [x] 26-04-PLAN.md — pgTAP tests for RLS cross-tenant isolation (ISOL-03)
- [x] 26-05-PLAN.md — API integration tests for role boundaries (RBAC-03, RBAC-04)
- [x] 26-06-PLAN.md — JWT claims to RLS function verification (ISOL-04)
- [x] 26-07-PLAN.md — API response data leak audit (ISOL-06)
- [x] 26-08-PLAN.md — Role propagation verification (RBAC-07)
