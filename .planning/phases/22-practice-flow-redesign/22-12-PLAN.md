<objective>
Replace the old new practice form with a redirect to the bulk-create flow for consistency.

Purpose: GAP-04 identified that /practices/new uses old PracticeForm which doesn't match the inline editing pattern established in Phase 22. The bulk-create flow is the new standard.

Output: /practices/new redirects to /practices/bulk-create with any passed parameters preserved.

  <action>
Replace the new practice page with a redirect to bulk-create:

1. Keep params handling for teamSlug extraction
2. Keep searchParams handling for seasonId and date
3. Build redirect URL: `/${teamSlug}/practices/bulk-create`
4. If seasonId provided, append as query param
5. If date provided (from calendar click), append as query param for bulk-create to use as default start date
6. Use redirect() from next/navigation

The bulk-create page already supports:
- Season selection
- Date range picking (can be single day)
- Template application
- All the features the old form had, plus more

This maintains backward compatibility for any links pointing to /practices/new (including calendar "Add Practice" buttons) while using the new flow.
  </action>
  <verify>
Visit /[teamSlug]/practices/new - redirects to /[teamSlug]/practices/bulk-create
Visit /[teamSlug]/practices/new?seasonId=xxx - redirects with seasonId preserved
Visit /[teamSlug]/practices/new?date=2026-01-30 - redirects with date preserved
Calendar "Add Practice" buttons still work (they link to /practices/new)
  </verify>
  <done>
New practice creation uses the bulk-create flow consistently. Old form retired.
  </done>

  <name>Task 2: Update bulk-create to handle single-date mode</name>

  </files>
  <action>
Enhance bulk-create to work well for single practice creation:

1. Accept `date` searchParam in bulk-create page
2. Pass initialDate prop to BulkPracticeCreator
3. In BulkPracticeCreator:
   - If initialDate provided, set both startDate and endDate to that date
   - This pre-selects the single day in the date picker
   - User can still expand to multi-day range if desired

4. Update header text dynamically:
   - If single date selected: "Create Practice for [date]"
   - If date range: "Create Practices ([count] dates)"

This makes the bulk-create page work seamlessly for both single practice (from calendar click) and bulk creation (from practices list button).
  </action>
  <verify>
Visit /bulk-create?date=2026-01-30 - date picker shows Jan 30 selected as both start and end
Submitting creates single practice for that date
Changing date range to multiple days still works
Header text updates based on selection count
  </verify>
  <done>
Bulk-create handles single-date mode gracefully, providing unified creation experience.
  </done>
</task>

- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [ ] /practices/new redirects to /practices/bulk-create
- [ ] Query parameters preserved through redirect
- [ ] Single-date mode works in bulk-create
- [ ] Calendar "Add Practice" links work correctly
- [ ] Multi-date bulk creation still works
</verification>

<success_criteria>
/practices/new redirects to bulk-create flow. Single practice creation from calendar uses the same flow as bulk creation. Consistent UX across all practice creation paths.
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/22-practice-flow-redesign/22-12-SUMMARY.md`
