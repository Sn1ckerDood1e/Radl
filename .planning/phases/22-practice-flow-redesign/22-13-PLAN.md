<objective>
Polish the workout interval row UI for better readability and less cramped layout.

Purpose: GAP-01 identified that the interval row is cramped with small inputs and unclear units. This is UX polish to improve the workout builder experience.

Output: Cleaner, more readable workout interval row with better spacing and clearer unit labels.

  <name>Task 1: Polish workout interval row layout</name>
  <files>

  </files>
  <action>
Improve the workout interval row layout for better readability:

1. Increase padding from p-2 to p-3 for breathing room
2. Change from single row to two-row layout on mobile:
   - Row 1: Interval number, duration type, duration value with unit
   - Row 2: Target (split/stroke rate), rest duration, rest type, delete button
   - Use flex-wrap with gap-3 for natural flow

3. Improve input widths:
   - Duration input: w-20 -> w-24
   - Target split input: w-16 -> w-20
   - Rest duration input: w-16 -> w-20

4. Add clearer labels:
   - Group duration type + value with "Duration:" label
   - Group target with "Target:" label (already has split/spm suffix)
   - Rest already has "Rest:" label, keep it

5. Use slightly larger text for unit labels:
   - Change text-xs to text-sm for unit labels (sec, m, /500m, spm, s)
   - Keep them text-zinc-400 for subtle but readable

6. Add subtle dividers between logical groups:
   - border-r border-zinc-700 after duration section
   - border-r border-zinc-700 after target section

7. Responsive behavior:
   - On mobile (< md): Stack into logical groups
   - On desktop: Single row with all elements

Style the row background slightly lighter (bg-zinc-800/70 instead of bg-zinc-800/50) for better contrast.
