<objective>
Final verification: confirm all PRC requirements are met through human acceptance testing.

Purpose: This plan completes the phase by performing a visual verification of the complete practice flow redesign.

Output: Complete working practice flow with all features from CONTEXT.md verified.

  <what-built>
Complete practice flow redesign implementation:
- Inline editing for practice details (name, date, times, notes)
- Block-based structure with WATER, ERG, LAND, MEETING types
- Sortable block list with drag-drop and arrow buttons
- PM5-style workout builder with intervals
- Multi-boat lineup builder with drag-drop
- Bulk practice creation with date range
- Bulk practice delete with multi-select
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to a practice detail page (e.g., `/{teamSlug}/practices/{practiceId}`)

**Inline Editing (PRC-01):**
- [ ] Click practice name - it becomes editable inline
- [ ] Edit name, click away (blur) - saves silently
- [ ] Edit date/time - saves on blur
- [ ] Edit notes - saves on blur
- [ ] Try to save invalid data - see error toast with retry

**Block Structure (PRC-02, PRC-03, PRC-08):**
- [ ] See block type buttons: +Water, +Erg, +Land, +Meeting
- [ ] Add a block - appears in list with type badge
- [ ] Drag block to reorder - order updates
- [ ] Use up/down arrows - order updates
- [ ] Delete a block - removed from list

**Water Block - Lineup (PRC-04, PRC-05, PRC-06):**
- [ ] Expand water block - see lineup builder
- [ ] Add a boat - see empty seat grid
- [ ] Drag athlete from roster to seat - assigned
- [ ] Assigned athlete removed from available list
- [ ] Drag athlete to occupied seat - swap occurs
- [ ] Add second boat - multiple boats in block
- [ ] Drag athlete between boats - moves directly
- [ ] Save lineups - persists on refresh

**Erg Block - Workout (PRC-04, PRC-07):**
- [ ] Expand erg block - see workout builder
- [ ] Select workout type (intervals)
- [ ] Add interval - row appears
- [ ] Set duration, target split, rest
- [ ] Add more intervals (see count: X/50)
- [ ] Save workout - persists on refresh
- [ ] Toggle athlete visibility - changes icon

**Bulk Operations:**
- [ ] Navigate to bulk create page
- [ ] Select date range and days (Mon/Wed/Fri)
- [ ] See practice count preview
- [ ] Create multiple practices - all appear in list
- [ ] On practice list, enter selection mode
- [ ] Select multiple practices with checkboxes
- [ ] Bulk delete - removes selected practices
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all requirements verified, or describe any issues found</resume-signal>

- [ ] All PRC requirements verified by human
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No console errors during testing

<success_criteria>
All 8 PRC requirements implemented:
- PRC-01: Inline editing - edit on-page, not separate form screens
- PRC-02: Block-based structure - practice divided into time blocks
- PRC-03: Block types - Water, Erg, Land, Meeting with type-specific forms
- PRC-04: Type-specific fields - water has boats/lineups, erg has workouts
- PRC-05: Drag-drop lineups - see available athletes, drag into seats
- PRC-06: Athlete availability - indicator of assigned vs available
- PRC-07: Workout display - structured intervals within blocks
- PRC-08: Block reordering - drag blocks to change order
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/22-practice-flow-redesign/22-09-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
